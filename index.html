        <h2 class="hand">Development</h2>
        <p class="text center">As a team we started the project using Figma. We used Figma to throw ideas at each other and to see what works best. Once we had created a digram that showed the base of the game and how it would work, we made a Trello to organzine a list on what needs to be done to best navigate when creating the game. Once we had a plan we used Replit to code.</p>
        <p class="text center"> Starting the project in figma really helped us to create the base of the game we wanted. We were able add ideas and collectively choose what we wanted in the game.</p>
        <p class="text center"> Using replit was a great way to write code together and have good communications between ourselvs. We were able to effectively problem solve any issues and debug the game.</p>

            <h2 class="hand">What we would do differently</h2>
            <p class="text center"> Towards the end of the project we were running out of time to finish the game so that it works without any problems. Giving more time to write code would help to finish on time, so better time management for writing the code would have been useful. 
            <p class="text center">Adding more levels within the game would have greatly improved the users experience, making the game harder to complete.</p>
            <p class="text center">Using replit was great for communicating between team members, but struggled to show some of the errors that might occur in visual code studio. Finding appropriate software for collective coding would have helped us out a lot.</p>
